===============================================================

Demo: http://mfirdaus.net/random/pasang.htm

Pasang (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasang) is a two player game. Well, you can read more about it on the page, but suffice to say that this is a javascript version of that. There's a good descrition on how to play here: http://homepages.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/gv/pasangemas.htm

This has a 'coffee license'. You may build an online game out of this if I don't. Attribution would help though.
